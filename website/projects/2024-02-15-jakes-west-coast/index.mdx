Jake's West Coast is my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@jakeswestcoast) that chronicles the mountain, gravel, and road biking rides that I do with my friends.
We typically ride the Santa Cruz mountains, San Francisco, or the North Bay. 

Focusing on capturing footage while doing a long effort exercise is difficult but it gives me something to think about while I'm riding. I have a few camera angles that help me tell the stories of our rides.

# Cameras

Primarily, I've mounted a GoPro under the saddle using a mount that clamps onto the rails. I'm not crazy about this location, because it blocks me from using a saddle bag, but it gives a really good angle.

As a secondary angle, I have a second, older gopro that I use for forward-facing footage. Depending on what kind of riding we do, this is either mounted using GoPro's bite mount, or a chest strap for a POV angle.

# Editing Process

Editing all the footage takes a good bit of effort as well, but I still try to get a one-day turnaround on videos to share with those that went on the ride. 

For the editing process, I use Davinci Resolve, a good node-based editor that allows me to do color grading in addition to cutting the video together. All footage is shot in log format.

When creating thumbnails, I use the FOSS software Gimp as a photo editor.
