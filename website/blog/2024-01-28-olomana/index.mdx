Whitney was the codename for my first homelab setup (For reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/). 
It was built out of my friend's handmedown hardware in an old server case that was e-wasted from school. 
This initial build was on the "janky" side, featuring an unmounted power supply in the optical bay, secured only by some green yarn. (Fire hazard, anyone?)
