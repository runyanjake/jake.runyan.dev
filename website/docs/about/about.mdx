# About Me

I'm an athlete, biker, and software engineer native to the Bay Area, working as a software engineer in Mountain View. 

On the weekends, you can catch me recording bike rides for my Youtube channel [Jake's West Coast](https://www.youtube.com/@jakeswestcoast), visiting with friends, or on a trip out in nature. 
I've had a very sports-heavy life, and currently play multiple volleyball leagues as well as a good bit of pickup basketball when I'm not at the gym. 

When it comes to work/technical interests, I love building and maintaining products/services that people can use broadly, frequently, and to great value. I engage in the practice of [homelabbing](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/), and maintain my server Olomana where this website is hosted, in addition to cool open-source software and many side projects in various stages of development. 

In my personal life, cooking is a side hobby, and if you're looking for a curated list of recipes, I maintain [recipes.whitney.rip](https://recipes.whitney.rip/), an ad-free personal online cookbook.

Thank you for checking out my website!

I can be contacted at jake@runyan.dev.
